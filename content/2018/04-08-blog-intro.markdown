I am going to try using this space to publish actual content. Expect articles
on tabletop gaming, linux devops, and photography.

I'm using [Pelican][pelican]'s blogging capabilities, and from that generating
static files that get uploaded whenever I make an entry. No muss, no fuss, no
Wordpress or Drupal attack surface.
