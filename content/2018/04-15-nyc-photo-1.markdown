summary: Day 1 (Wednesday, 28 March 2018) in NYC
---

Our first day in New York, our flight got into LaGuardia at about 11 am, and
the bus to the Upper West Side took about an hour. We found our hotel and left
our bags there until we could check in.

The hotel was near Broadway and 97th street, so we decided to walk the three
blocks to Central Park and wander around for a while. We ended up walking up at
81st, near the American Museum of Natural History, before heading into the park
again and walking along the lake.

All the pictures in today's gallery were taken in Central Park.
