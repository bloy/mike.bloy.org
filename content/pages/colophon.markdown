This site was written by hand in [VIM][vim], and designed directly in the
browser. It uses [jQuery][jquery] for behavior, but does not require javascript
to access the content of the site. It will look best in a modern browser, but
will degrade gracefully to display its content in any web browser.
[PostCSS][postcss] and [CSSNext][cssnext] were used to managed the CSS, and
[Pelican][pelican] generated the html from templates and markdown.

The source for this website is [available on Github][source].

The SVG images used as backgrounds are from [Hero Patterns][heropatterns].  The
social [Webicons][webicons] are from [Fairhead Creative][fairheadcreative],
except for the [Keybase][keybase] icon, which came directly from Keybase.
