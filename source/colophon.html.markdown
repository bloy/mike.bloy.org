This site was written by hand in [VIM][1], and designed directly in the
browser. It uses [jQuery][2] for behavior, but does not require javascript to
access the content of the site. It will look best in a modern browser, but will
degrade gracefully to display its content in any web browser technology.
[Compass][3] and [Sass][4] were used to manage the CSS.

The background texture comes from [ava7 patterns][5], used with thanks. The
background photograph was taken by me.

Fonts are from [Font Squirrel][6]. The masthead font is [TeX Gyre Pagella][7],
and the body font is [TeX Gyre Adventor][8].
