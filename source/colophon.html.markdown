This site was written by hand in [VIM][vim], and designed directly in the
browser. It uses [jQuery][jquery] for behavior, but does not require javascript
to access the content of the site. It will look best in a modern browser, but
will degrade gracefully to display its content in any web browser.
[Susy][susy], [Compass][compass], and [Sass][sass] were used to manage the CSS,
and [Middleman][middleman] was used as a preprocessor.

The source for this website is [available on Github][source].

Fonts are from [Font Squirrel][fontsquirrel]. The masthead font is [TeX Gyre
Pagella][fs-pagella], and the body font is [TeX Gyre Adventor][fs-adventor].

[Webicons][webicons] are from [Fairhead Creative][fairheadcreative].
