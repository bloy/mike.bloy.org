  title: Introduction

I'm Mike Bloy. You either know me, or have heard of me, or Google has dropped
you here in a freak search engine accident.

I am a husband and father. I am a programmer and web developer. I live in
Wisconsin.

I am *not* the sales director in Boston, or the insurance salesman in
Germany, or the teacher in the UAE, or the compliance specialist in the UK

If you are one of those other guys who share my name, hi! Drop me an email!
