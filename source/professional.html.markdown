I'm a developer, linux consultant, web standards advocate, and
version control guru.

I currently work as a contractor for the [State of Wisconsin Court
System][wicourts].  Their opinions are theirs, mine are mine. This page
contains my opinions, not theirs.  Previous employers have been: a startup, a
telecom company, a production house, a nonprofit, and a university.

I can write code productively in Ruby, Java, Python, or Perl. I'm slightly less
efficient in PHP, or C++, having lost the day-to-day knowledge. Any other
language, I can puzzle out and make modifications to existing code, but would
take a week or so to get up to speed.  Programming is programming, no matter
the language. The differences are just idiom.

I can and do install and maintain linux on the desktop or as a server. I prefer
[Debian][debian].  I've been responsible for installing and maintaining web
servers, database servers, email servers, version control repositories, jabber
servers, file servers, and continuous integration servers.

I have been creating web pages since 1995, before there were web standards to
be concerned with. These days I know the value of good content and code that is
kind to search engines and accessibility software, and pages that work even if
their behavior is disabled. I've tracked the development of CSS-based design
and unobtrusive javascript since their beginnings, and applied them as they
evolved.
